All my life
I've been walking on my own
Along the lonely road of the heart
On my side
I got symphonies and songs
To help me find my way
Through the dark
Oh, six in the morning
With nowhere to go
Sing hello world
It feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark
But I'll never be alone
Sing hello world
It feels so good to be home
Sing hello world
It feels so good to be home
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes
And said hello to the world
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my еyes
And said hello to the world
All night long
I'vе been talking to myself
The voices in my head don't cry
On my mind
I become somebody else
So this is how it feels to say goodbye
Oh, six in the morning
With nowhere to go
Sing hello world
It feels so good to be home
Lost in the dark
But I'll never be alone
Sing hello world
It feels so good to be home
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes
And said hello to the world
Hello, hello, hello world
I open my eyes
And said hello to the world
