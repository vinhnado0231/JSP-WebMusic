our eyes, alight in flames
Like lights along the way
The beautiful ones light up the world
So we don't feel invisible
When I'm made for all, not unbreakable
We're all lost in the night
Love is chemical, hearts all flammable
When we turn off the lights
The ritual fires
They light up and guide us
Shining inside us
Calling out la la la
The ritual fires
The falling of triumphs
A beautiful riot
In all of us
La la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
They light up and guide us
The ritual fires la la la
The lights call up our name
Tonight we're all thе same
And we are thе sun, light up the world
The darkness is doing some ritual
When I'm made for all, not unbreakable
We're just lost in the night
Love is chemical, hearts all flammable
So just turn off the lights
The ritual fires
They light up and guide us
Shining like diamonds
Calling out la la la
The ritual fires
The falling of triumphs
A beautiful riot
In all of us
La la la la la la
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
They light up and guide us
The ritual fires la la la
